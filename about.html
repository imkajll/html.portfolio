<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi, my name is Kajal. I am a psychology student who is very interested in web development. 
  I have completed my graduation from Lucknow University in 2022. 
  I wanted to develop new skills so I applied for this udemy course which is by far my best decision. 
  At first, it always seem so impossible but now I'm hoping to learn more about coding and programming. 
  Wish me Luck!!

  I have few hobbies which has become my daily ritual now.
  They are: reading on my kindle, playing sudoku, cooking pasta, learning about ingrediants and how to obtain them organic and fresh, watching mukbangs and asmr videos, and much much more.
  You can always find me reading comment sections and laughing on memes and that's how my day usually goes, <em>'Youtube and Memes'.</em>

  I am a potato couch. 
  I watch a lot of movies and series whenever I am bored. 
  I have a really nice music taste but if you have a recommendation, find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kajal-singh-3a844527b/">Kajal Singh</a> (LinkedIn).
