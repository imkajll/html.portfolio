<h1>The Best Series According to Kajal</h1>

<H2>My Top 5 Series of all time</H2>

<hr>

<h3>Harry Potter Series</h3>

<p>It is one of the wonderful movies of all time. Recently I started reading books of the series itself. I love Warner Brother's Production, and the intro with its music is the best part. I love all the characters, and the entire story is build on a magical world. Hogwarts is the best magical school.</p>

<h3>Naruto Shippuden</h3>

<p>It is again the epic anime of all time. I am a weeb and watching anime consumes a huge amount of hours in my entire day. I love the story and its characters. This series has a first part as 'Naruto' and the second part as 'Naruto Shippuden'. The music and the characters is the main charm.</p>

<h3>Stranger Things</h3>

<p>This sci-fi series by Netflix is again a bomb. I love all the characters but the main eye catching element for me is the super powers and the upside down world. Dungon & Dragons became a curious topic for me to search about. I will probably learn how to play it, of course when I have time.</p>

<h3>Game Of Thrones</h3> 

<p>GOT is one of the best series by HBO. I love fictional stories and what's better than the story of kings and queens. A little twist though, everybody wants to have the throne to themselves and rule over the seven kingdoms. I learn about how one should be clever and smart, yet strong to be a successful leader.</p>

<h3>Spiderman Series</h3>

<p>Spiderman is my favourite marvel hero. Latest movie series of Spiderman: Into the spiderverse and Across the spiderverse just stole my heart. There is nothing more a spiderman fan needs to watch. I also love all the spiderman movie parts that I conclude as a movie series. I LOVE GWEN STACY!</p>
